Vitamin D for fracture prevention
=================================

This repository contains the [source data](https://github.com/badgettrg/Vitamin-D-for-fracture-prevention/tree/master/data) and matching [forest plots](https://github.com/badgettrg/Vitamin-D-for-fracture-prevention/tree/master/forest%20plots) for an [open  meta-analysis](https://public.opencpu.org/ocpu/github/badgettrg/openMetaAnalysis/www/) of Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of fractures.

This meta-analysis suggests that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a reduction in fractures when given in effective doses (see Figure). Effective is defined as a dose that raises the serum level of vitamin D by 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) and achieves a final level of at least 60 nmol/L (24 ng/mL). See the [clinical summary](https://github.com/badgettrg/Vitamin-D-for-fracture-prevention/wiki/Clinical-summary) for more detail. The complete review is in development for peer review and journal publication.

**Figure**. All trials subgrouped by effective or inneffective dose of Vitamin D.
