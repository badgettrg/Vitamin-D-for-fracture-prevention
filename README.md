Vitamin D for fracture prevention
=================================

This repository contains the source data and matching forest plots for a meta-analysis of Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of fractures.

This meta-analysis suggests that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a reduction in fractures when given in effective doses (see Figure). Effective is defined as a dose that raises the serum level of vitamin D by 20 nmol/L (8 ng/mL) and achieves a final level of at least 60 nmol/L (24 ng/mL). See the [clinical summary](https://github.com/badgettrg/Vitamin-D-for-fracture-prevention/wiki/Clinical-summary) for details.

**Figure**. All trials subgrouped by effective or inneffective dose of Vitamin D.
